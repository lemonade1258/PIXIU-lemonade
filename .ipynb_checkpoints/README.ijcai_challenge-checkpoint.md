## Task 1 Financial Classification Starter Kit
### Introduction
This task focuses on argument unit classification to test the capabilities of LLMs to identify and categorize texts as premises or claims. Participants receive a financial text and two options, following design the prompt query template, and then classify the text as a claim or premise.

We provide 7.75k training data and 969 test data to categorize sentences as claims or premises. 

We use the following prompt template to ask and answer the question in this task.

Instruction: [task prompt] Text: [input text] Response: [output]

[input text] denotes the financial text in the prompt, [output] is the classified label  (i.e., "Claim" or "Premise"). 

### Performance Metrics
We use two metrics to evaluate classification capability, like F1 and Accuracy. 
We use F1 score as the final ranking metrics.

### Evaluation
You can follow the instructions in the [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ogcCmhMc5lPhUamCk6512H3PJwPEaBZN?usp=sharing) to do evaluations on Task 1: financial classification.

### Dataset Example
| id |	query |	answer |	text	| choices	| gold |
| -- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| finargeccauc0 | Analyze sentences from earnings conference calls and identify their argumentative function. Each sentence is either a premise, offering evidence or reasoning, or a claim, asserting a conclusion or viewpoint. Return only premise or claim. Text: I mean, sometimes it's not that you came up with some brilliant strategy, it's just like really good work consistently over a long period of time. Answer:	| premise | I mean, sometimes it's not that you came up with some brilliant strategy, it's just like really good work consistently over a long period of time. | [ "premise", "claim" ] | 0 |
| finargeccauc1 | Analyze sentences from earnings conference calls and identify their argumentative function. Each sentence is either a premise, offering evidence or reasoning, or a claim, asserting a conclusion or viewpoint. Return only premise or claim. Text: Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. Answer: | claim | Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. | [ "premise", "claim" ] | 1 |



## Task 2 Financial Text Summarization Starter Kit
### Introduction
This task is designed to test the capabilities of LLMs to generate coherent summaries. Participants need to summarize a corresponding concise text according to the given financial news text, following the designed prompt template of query. 

We provide 8k training data and 2k test data for abstract financial news articles into concise summaries.  

We use the following prompt template to ask and answer the question in this task.

Instruction: [task prompt] Context: [input context] Response: [output]

[input text] denotes the multiple-sentence text in financial news article, [output] is the abstractive summarization on this text.

### Performance Metrics
We utilize three metrics, such as ROUGE (1, 2, and L) and BERTScore, to evaluate generated summaries in terms of Relevance.  
We use ROUGE -1 score as the final ranking metrics.

### Evaluation
You can follow the instructions in the [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ogcCmhMc5lPhUamCk6512H3PJwPEaBZN?usp=sharing) to do evaluations on Task 2: financial text summarization.

Elidah was the only company from the United States awarded this distinction, and one of two start-ups in the life science category.Normally held in Singapore,this year the event was virtual and offered a record $750,000 in cash prizes by StartUpSG. One hundred companies pitched at the live event, and from those ten finalists were selected. The award winners included start-ups from all over the world including Israel, United Kingdom, Singapore, and India, among others.

I was impressed by the other finalists, advancing technologies such as biometric security, artificial intelligence, and gene editing." Although the top prize went to another start-up, Ms. Kolb, as the only female entrepreneur in the finals, was happy to see a company focused on women's health receive recognition. "Women's health should not be a taboo subject, and I hope that investors realize it presents a large market, ripe for innovation." ELITONE is the first home-health device that performs the hard-to-do pelvic floor exercises for women. It operates externally, without the invasiveness of vaginal probes. Exercises are needed to tone the pelvic floor muscles, but they can be hard to do correctly. The wearable nature of ELITONE allows women to do other activities while getting treatment at home, saving time, cost, and risk of infection. In a time when the clinics and pelvic floor physical therapy offices have shut down, at-home over-the-counter devices like ELITONE provide much-needed access to effective FDA-cleared treatments.

## Task 3 Single Stock Trading Starter Kit
### Introduction
This task aims to evaluate LLMs’ ability to make sophisticated decisions in trading activities, which is currently restricted by human’s limited ability to process large volumes of data rapidly. Participants receive a combination of open-source data for stocks and an ETF. The system should output one of the three trading decisions (“buy”, “sell”, “hold”) with reasonings. 

We provide 291 data to evaluate LLMs on sophisticated stock decisions. 

We use the following prompt template to ask and answer the question in this task.

Instruction: [task prompt] Context: [input context] Response: [output]

[input text] denotes the financial investment information in the prompt, [output] should strictly conform the following JSON format without any additional contents: {"investment_decision": string, "summary_reason": string, "short_memory_index": number, "middle_memory_index": number, "long_memory_index": number,  "reflection_memory_index": number}

### Performance Metrics
We offer a comprehensive assessment of profitability, risk management, and decision-making prowess by a series of metrics, such as Sharpe Ratio (SR), Cumulative Return (CR), Daily (DV) and Annualized volatility (AV), and Maximum Drawdown (MD). 

We use Sharpe Ratio (SR) score as the final ranking metrics.

The formulas are as follows:

## Fine-tune
We recommend you to use [AutoTrain-Advanced](https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced.git) to train your models.

## Model Cheating Detection
To measure the risk of data leakage from the test set used in the training of a model, the Model Cheating, we have developed a new metric called the Data Leakage Test (DLT), building on existing research.

The DLT calculates the difference in perplexity of the large language models (LLMs) on both the training and test data to determine its data generation tendencies. Specifically, we separately input the training set and the test set into the LLMs, and calculate the perplexity on the training set (ppl-on-train) and the perplexity on the test set (ppl-on-test). The DLT value is then computed by subtracting the ppl-on-train from the ppl-on-test. A larger difference implies that the LLM is less likely to have seen the test set during training compared to the training set and suggests a lower likelihood of the model cheating. Conversely, a smaller difference implies that the LLM is more likely to have seen the test set during training and suggests a higher likelihood of the model cheating.

In the detection process, we will calculate the DLT values for some LLMs to establish a reference baseline of Model Cheating, and minimize the impact of generalization on the metric. The formula is as follows:
